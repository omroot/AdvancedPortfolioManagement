    "4. **If the percentage of idiosyncratic variance is low, identify the group of factors responsible for it.**\n",
    "   - For guidance regarding acceptable levels of factor risk, see Section 7.2.1.\n",

    "   - Include factors that have exposures exceeding the single-factor exposures, as discussed in Section 7.2.4.\n",
    "   - Pinpoint the key factors driving the portfolio's risk and those with significant exposures.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Identify the trades by asset that both reduce overall factor risk and the specific factor exposure.**\n",
    "   - Choose trades compatibly with your fundamental convictions and with your goals to reduce or increase the Gross Market Value (GMV) of the portfolio.\n",
    "   - Determine asset-specific trades that align with your investment theses while managing factor risks effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Change the positions in a direction that is:**\n",
    "   - (a) Compatible with your convictions;\n",
    "   - (b) Reducing factor risk to an acceptable level;\n",
    "   - (c) Reducing exposures to individual factors that you are currently targeting.\n",
    "   - Adjust the portfolio to align with your fundamental beliefs, ensuring factor risks are mitigated to acceptable levels, and focus on targeted factor exposures.\n",

    "1. **Automatic Hedging Program**:\n",

This involves trading a broad, liquid universe of stocks without altering the original stock sizes chosen by the portfolio manager.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. **Fully Automated Portfolio Construction**:\n",
    "   - Input investment ideas into a portfolio optimizer, which generates and updates the portfolio to reflect core ideas efficiently, maintain factor risk within limits, and adapt to market conditions and new ideas systematically."
